Kiro is an experimental AI-powered IDE from AWS that's changing how developers build software. Unlike traditional code completion tools, Kiro uses agentic reasoning to handle complex, multi-step development workflows automatically. The big innovation? You focus on *what* you want to build instead of *how* to build it line by line.

### How Kiro Works: Spec-Driven Development

At its core, Kiro operates on a spec-driven approach. You provide specifications and requirements, and Kiro plans and executes development tasks with minimal intervention. This changes your role from writing every line of code to guiding the AI through clear specifications and feedback.

The agentic reasoning loop that powers Kiro follows four steps:
1. Planning what needs to be done
2. Reasoning through the best approach
3. Taking action to implement the solution
4. Evaluating results and making improvements

### Key Technical Features

### Context Awareness
Kiro integrates with your local environment through protocols like MCP (Multi-Context Protocol) and Language Server Protocol (LSP). This gives it access to local files and tools for real-time, context-rich assistance.

### Privacy and Security
All code execution happens locally, ensuring your data stays private. The IDE's actions are transparent and auditable, preventing unintentional data exposure.

### Extensibility
You can extend Kiro with custom MCP servers and connect it with Amazon Q CLI for real-time code analysis and problem-solving.

### Autonomy Options
- **Autopilot mode**: Kiro automatically modifies code in your workspace
- **Supervised mode**: You review and approve changes before they're applied

### Smart Chat Interface
Kiro understands commands related to specific files or folders through chat context tags (#File, #Folder) and even accepts images in chats for richer interactions.

### Benefits for Developers

### Less Context Switching
Kiro understands your project's context and intent, reducing time spent jumping between files, documentation, and debugging tools. This is especially helpful in large codebases or when working with unfamiliar projects.

### From Writing to Steering
Instead of writing code line by line, you steer Kiro by defining specifications and providing feedback. This dramatically increases productivity and code consistency.

### Easy Transition
You can import existing VS Code configurations, including themes and extensions, making the switch to Kiro smoother.

### Performance Highlights

Based on third-party reviews, Kiro delivers:
- 92-96% accuracy on complex tasks like API creation, React component development, and database schema design
- Moderate system resource usage (1-1.4GB of memory)
- Better consistency and complexity management compared to competitors, though sometimes with slightly longer response times
